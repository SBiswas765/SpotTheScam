Requirements for the Streamlit "Spot the Scam" Application
This list specifies the Python libraries and their versions (or compatible versions) needed to run the Streamlit application.

Python Version:

Python 3.7+ (generally, recent versions are preferred, e.g., 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
Python Libraries (from requirements.txt equivalent):

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn (or sklearn)
nltk
faker
streamlit
matplotlib
seaborn
re (part of standard Python library, no separate install needed)
NLTK Data:

stopwords corpus (NLTK will attempt to download this if not found).
Operating System:

Any OS that supports Python and the listed libraries (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Hardware:

Basic CPU and RAM sufficient for running Python scripts and a web browser. The resource usage will depend on the size of the uploaded CSV files and the simulated data.
Requirements for the Flask "Spot the Scam" Application
This list specifies the Python libraries and their versions (or compatible versions) needed to run the Flask application.

Python Version:

Python 3.7+ (generally, recent versions are preferred, e.g., 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
Python Libraries (from requirements.txt equivalent):

flask
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn (or sklearn)
nltk
faker
re (part of standard Python library, no separate install needed)
NLTK Data:

stopwords corpus (NLTK will attempt to download this if not found).
Operating System:

Any OS that supports Python and the listed libraries (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Hardware:

Basic CPU and RAM sufficient for running Python scripts and a web server. Resource usage will depend on the size of uploaded CSVs and the number of concurrent users (though this simple Flask app is designed for single-user interaction).
Additional Files:

HTML Templates: Flask requires index.html and result.html files to render the web interface. These were implicitly mentioned in the Flask code's render_template calls. Without these files, the Flask application will not run correctly.
