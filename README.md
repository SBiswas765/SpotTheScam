Spot the Scam is an intelligent web application designed to detect potentially fraudulent job postings using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). This project simulates real-world job listings and identifies scams with high accuracy using a Logistic Regression classifier trained on TF-IDF features. This machine learning-based web app built with Flask allows users to upload job listings in CSV format and predicts whether each job is likely genuine (0) or a scam (1) based on the job title and description.
